# Kaggle Competitions Portfolio

Welcome to my Kaggle Competitions Portfolio! This repository showcases my work on various Kaggle competitions, highlighting my skills in data science, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project contains a detailed notebook with insights, methodologies, and results.

## Competitions
Below is a list of competitions I have participated in, along with links to their respective project folders:

- [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/s-puget/kaggle-competitions/tree/main/titanic-survival-prediction)


## Repository Structure
Each folder contains the following:
- **Notebook**: The main Jupyter notebook showcasing the analysis, model building, and results.
- **README**: A detailed explanation of the competition, approach, and key takeaways.
- **Additional Files**: Any supplementary files such as datasets (if allowed), trained models, or visualizations.

Example folder structure:
```
competition-name/
├── README.md
├── notebook
├── submission.csv
├── datasets/ (optional)
└── models/ (optional)
```

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Cleaning and understanding data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create impactful visualizations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Crafting meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing and fine-tuning models such as logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, and deep learning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics like accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, etc.
