# 🏆 Kaggle Competition - Private School Challenge  

This repository contains my solution for a **private Kaggle competition** organized at my school, where we competed against classmates. The challenge was a **sales prediction task**, where we had to forecast the sales quantity for a list of new products based on historical sales data.  

- **🥈 Rank:** **2nd Place**  
- **📉 Score (MSE):** `12492.92410`
